    "## 為何搜尋比微調更好\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT可以以兩種方式學習知識：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 透過模型權重（即，在訓練集上微調模型）\n",
    "- 透過模型輸入（即，將知識插入到輸入訊息中）\n",
    "\n",
    "雖然微調可能看起來是更自然的選擇——畢竟，透過數據訓練是GPT學習所有其他知識的方式——但我們通常不建議將它作為教導模型知識的方式。微調更適合教授專門的任務或風格，對於事實記憶的可靠性較差。\n",
    "\n",
    "作為類比，模型權重就像長期記憶。當你微調一個模型時，就像是為一周後的考試做準備。當考試到來時，模型可能會忘記細節，或錯誤記憶它從未讀過的事實。\n",
    "\n",
    "相比之下，訊息輸入就像短期記憶。當你將知識插入到一條訊息中時，就像是帶著筆記參加開卷考試。有了筆記在手，模型更可能得出正確的答案。\n",
    "\n",
    "相對於微調，文本搜尋的一個缺點是每個模型都受到它一次能讀多少文本的限制：\n",
    "\n",
    "| 模型           | 最大文本長度       |\n",
    "|-----------------|---------------------------|\n",
    "| `gpt-3.5-turbo` | 4,096 tokens (~5頁)   |\n",
    "| `gpt-4`         | 8,192 tokens (~10頁)  |\n",
    "| `gpt-4-32k`     | 32,768 tokens (~40頁) |\n",
    "\n",
    "延續這個類比，你可以將模型想像成一個學生，儘管可能有書架上的教科書可供參考，但他一次只能看幾頁筆記。\n",
    "\n",
    "因此，為了建立一個能夠利用大量文本回答問題的系統，我們建議使用搜尋-問答的方法。\n"

    "## 搜尋\n",
    "\n",
    "有許多方式可以搜尋文本。例如：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 基於詞彙的搜尋\n",
    "- 基於圖形的搜尋\n",
    "- 基於嵌入式的搜尋\n",
    "\n",
    "這個範例筆記本使用的是基於嵌入式的搜尋。[嵌入式](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)的實現簡單，並且對於問題特別有效，因為問題往往與其答案在詞彙上不重疊。\n",
    "\n",
    "將只基於嵌入式的搜尋視為你自己系統的起點。更好的搜尋系統可能結合了多種搜尋方法，以及像是熱門度、最近性、用戶歷史、與先前搜尋結果的重複性、點擊率數據等特性。問答檢索的性能也可以通過像[HyDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496)這樣的技術來提高，在這種技術中，問題首先被轉化為假設的答案，然後再進行嵌入。同樣地，GPT也可以通過自動將問題轉化為一組關鍵詞或搜尋詞來改進搜尋結果。"

    "    1. 收集：我們將下載幾百篇關於2022年奧運會的維基百科文章\n",
    "    2. 分塊：文檔被分割成短的、大部分自成一體的章節進行嵌入\n",
    "    3. 嵌入：每個章節都使用OpenAI API進行嵌入\n",
    "    4. 儲存：嵌入式被保存（對於大數據集，使用向量數據庫）\n",

    "    1. 給定用戶問題，從OpenAI API生成查詢的嵌入式\n",
    "    2. 使用嵌入式，按照與查詢的相關性對文本章節進行排序\n",
    "3. 問答（每次查詢一次）\n",
    "    1. 將問題和最相關的章節插入到GPT的訊息中\n",
    "    2. 返回GPT的答案\n",
    "\n",
    "### 成本\n",
    "\n",
    "由於GPT比嵌入式搜尋更貴，因此有一定量查詢的系統將其成本主要由步驟3佔據。\n",
    "\n",
    "- 對於`gpt-3.5-turbo`，每次查詢使用~1,000 tokens，每次查詢的成本大約為~$0.002，即每美元大約可進行500次查詢（截至2023年4月）\n",
    "- 對於`gpt-4`，同樣假設每次查詢使用~1,000 tokens，每次查詢的成本大約為~$0.03，即每美元大約可進行30次查詢（截至2023年4月）\n",
    "\n",

Six nations qualified via World Championship qualification placement, while three nations qualified through qualification events. In men's and women's play, a host will be selected for the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE). They would be joined by the teams which competed at the 2021 World Championships but did not qualify for the Olympics, and two qualifiers from the Pre-Olympic Qualification Event (Pre-OQE).
